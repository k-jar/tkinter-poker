This game is a recreation of Texas Hold'em Poker.
This guide is a very basic overview of the game.

At the start you receive two cards (called holecards), after everyone has their cards there is a round of betting.
In these betting rounds you can choose to, check/call, raise or fold.
 When you fold you are out of the game, if there is a bet to match you must call (match this bet) to stay in the game. 
If there is no bet to match you can check (you bet nothing). 
The game automatically checks whether you can check or call. 
You may also raise the bet using the slider to set the amount you want to raise.
After this, three community cards are shown and there is another round of betting.
The next two community cards are shown one at a time, with a round of betting after each card.
Finally, there is the showdown where all remaining players show their hands.

You form your hand by combining cards from your holecards and the community cards to get the best possible combination. 
This game automatically forms the best possible hand for you.
Your formed hand can consist of just community cards.

You win by having a better hand than other players that are still in the game. 
If you are the only player left you automatically win.
